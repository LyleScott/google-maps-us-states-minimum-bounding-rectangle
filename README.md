Each state is a polygon drawn by connecting a series of latitude / longitude coordinates. These polygons are invisible and are used for attaching mouse events so that when your mouse cursor is within a polygon, a specific event can triggered.

In this case, that is drawing a polygon representing the minimum bounding rectangle for a US state.
