Each state is a polygon drawn by connecting a series of latitude / longitude coordinates. These polygons are invisible and are used for mapping mouse-over events to so that when your mouse is over a polygon, a polygon specific event can be fired.

In this case, that is drawing a polygon representing the minimum bounding rectangle for a US state.
